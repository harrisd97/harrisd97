# Hi there, I'm Harish! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

A results-driven **Data Engineer / SQL Developer** with over 4 years of experience in designing and developing scalable data solutions using **Oracle 12c/19c**, **PL/SQL**, **T-SQL**, **SQL Server**, and **SSIS**. I specialize in building efficient ETL processes, optimizing database performance, and transforming complex data into actionable business insights.

At MSC Technology, I contributed to enterprise-grade data systems by transforming **JSON/XML data**, optimizing large-scale queries, and supporting logistics systems with robust data models. My work included the development of ETL packages, custom reports, and performance-tuned solutions that supported mission-critical business operations.

Currently pursuing a **Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics for Business** at **St. Clair College (Ontario)**, I am expanding my expertise into **cloud-based data platforms** such as **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks (Apache Spark, Delta Lake)**, and **Microsoft Fabric** to align with modern data engineering practices.

I am highly proficient in **Power BI**, **Python (Pandas)**, and **Agile methodologies**, and have demonstrated leadership through mentorship and collaboration in cross-functional teams.

🏆 Recognitions:
- *Best Developer Award* – MSC Technology  
- *Academic Excellence Scholarship* – St. Clair College (twice)

📍 Open to **Data Engineer**, **SQL Developer**, or **ETL Developer** opportunities across Canada (Hybrid/Remote).
